This is what I felt while posting after 3 months!!
I have a favour/request for my readers at the end of my post please read it!

Hey, fam! Advance Happy New Year #2024!
This year has been a whirlwind of growth, not just in technical prowess but also in life lessons. Amidst challenges, I've seized several opportunities that have broadened my horizons:

Taking on the role of Vice President at UNYC LPU, where I had the privilege of leading and learning from a team of 80 exceptional individuals.

Diving into data visualisation and analysis, particularly exploring music datasets?a fascinating blend of technology and the world of music.

Acquiring fresh certifications in the full-stack domain underscores my commitment to staying abreast of technological advancements.

Engaging in my maiden hackathon experience, courtesy of Lovely Professional University?an event that both challenged and inspired me.
Collaborating on my inaugural full-stack project alongside Jaswanth Singh Kumar Lankadasu, LANKADASU NAGA VENKATA YASWANTH, Satya Reddy and an outstanding team. It was a journey not just in creation but also in refining it into a robust, impactful product.

And this is merely a glimpse!

NxtWave's tech skills report stands as a testament to my dedication?a rewarding 100 days of coding, solving over 600 problems, with a learning time totalling 11,326 minutes and maintaining a streak of 28 days.

My heartfelt gratitude goes out to Rahul Attuluri, Jaswanth Singh Kumar Lankadasu, LANKADASU NAGA VENKATA YASWANTH, Kantheti Venkata Sahil, and other remarkable individuals. Their unwavering support, collaborative spirit, and mentorship have been invaluable throughout this transformative journey.

Request:
I've recently developed a keen interest in advancing my skills in line with research in quantum computing. If any of my connections know someone skilled in quantum computing who could offer guidance, I would greatly appreciate being connected with them.

Any resources related to quantum computing that anyone could share in the comments section would be immensely appreciated! Thank you in advance for any guidance or materials you can provide.

Thanks a lot!

I'm thrilled to share my recent experience at the Gear Up Season 2 hackathon, a gateway event for the Smart India Hackathon 2023, hosted by Lovely Professional University.

Over the course of 36 intense hours, my team and I successfully developed and deployes a fully dynamic website complete with a sequential chatbot. Additionally, we deployed an NLP model using a decision tree algorithm tailored to our specific problem statement. Gathering relevant data proved to be a challenge, but we overcame it by creating our own dataset from matching books and utilizing web scraping techniques to extract information from upto 100 web pages.

This hackathon was a thrilling roller coaster ride, filled with valuable lessons and challenges that pushed our boundaries. I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn, build, and collaborate closely with my talented teammates.

I want to extend my appreciation to my incredible teammates: LANKADASU NAGA VENKATA YASWANTH, Jaswanth Singh Kumar Lankadasu, Pranav Rangavajhula, Satya Reddy, and Navya Ramani. We made a fantastic team, and I'm eagerly looking forward to future collaborations with you all! ?

I'm thrilled to introduce my two chatbots: 
? Crystal Text (Link: https://lnkd.in/g8wpindX ) and 
?? Crystal Voice (Link: https://lnkd.in/gFfMimM5 ) ?

I created them during an amazing 3-hour Generative AI mega workshop by NxtWave, brilliantly explained by Rahul Attuluri. 

Crystal Text is a Text-to-Text bot, while Crystal Voice is a Text-to-Voice bot, trained with my own voice (though my English is still better than my bot's ?).

During the workshop, I gained valuable insights into various AI tools, including:

? AI Text tools: Rytr. me, jasper, write sonic, copy.ai
? AI Image Tools: DALLE-2, Midjourney, Dream by Wombo, crayon
? AI Video Tools: Runway ML, Pictory, Deepbreain AI
?? AI Speech Tools: PlayHT, Murfai, Fliki
? AI Music Tools: Mubert, Beat Box
? AI Website Tools: Framer
? AI Code generation tools: GitHub Copilot, Seek, Durable

In the process of creating these bots, I utilized some fantastic tools, such as Google Colab, OpenAI APIs, Langchain, Gradio, PlayHT, and Hugging Face. ??

Cons of these bots: They are not Fast enough as i have used all the free resources

Can't wait to see how these bots evolve and contribute to the world of AI! ?? #ai  #chatbots  #generativeai  #linkedinpost  #excitingprojects  #techenthusiast  #openai #huggingface #nxtwave #rahulattuluri #community #reach #consistency #sundaymotivation ",

"You uploaded a feed photo on January 6, 2023 at 6:10 PM (GMT)","Hello!! connections,

Today I have completed the Promptbase challenge by NxtWave

The main objective of the challenge is to get a detailed overview of prompts, prompt engineering, and upload the 5 best pictures of the generated pictures with their prompt and seed values

The main things I have learned during the challenge are...
->What AI art and stable diffusion are...
->I have studied and experimented with various AI art models such as :
    Dreamstudio
    DALL.E 2
    Google collaboratory workspace
    Midjourney

->During this process, I have got to know how to input prompts for different AI models and different ways to study an AI model

The thing is none of these pictures exists in the real world, and the places, persons and objects generated by the model are completely generated by the AI model itself!!!

I would like to Thank Rahul Attuluri sir and #nxtwaveteam for including this amazing AI Art in the #flyhighchallenge phase 2

After a long time, I'm happy to be back with my 2022 progress
I've taken courses in NxtWave around March/April 2022. Since then I've been much more productive in my time. I myself can't believe that I have solved around ""600 CODING QUESTIONS"" in just 8 MONTHS!!!!
and I've almost spent more than 19860 MINUTES ?  learning new technologies and I've been actively learning for 185 days!!!

This year I have participated/completed/participating in:
->Independence Day Mega Challenge
->Fly High Challenge phase 1
->Fly High Challenge phase 2
->GSoC(Google Summer of code) Preparation series
->Ai Art project sessions
->Build Your own static website(49+hrs) modules
->Buld your own responsive website(50+hrs) modules
->Programming foundations in python(72+hrs) modules
->Build your own Dynamic website(91+hrs) modules

In this one year, I have gained basic knowledge on Open source projects, Command line, Generative AI, AI art, and many other basics of 4.0 technologies.

I would like to Thank NxtWave Rahul Attuluri sir and #nxtwaveteam for keeping the sessions more interactive and enthusiastic.

I'm happy? to share that I have completed #flyhighchallenge phase 1 and  Entered #flyhighchallenge phase 2 successfully.
This is also an 8-week challenge for my consistency in which I have to reach the target set for a minimum of 5 weeks and have to attend a minimum of 3 Academy exclusive podcasts/master classes out of 4 and have to complete 2 mini projects out of 3.

This time it looks like a big challenge for me to manage my Endterm Exams and this challenge. But I will try my level best to reach the final phase of this challenge.

At last, I would like to thank? NxtWave, Rahul Attuluri sir, and Sashank Gujjula sir for designing such a wonderful Course and challenge.
